I recently wrote a spec for one of my favorite shows on TV. Comedy Central's CORPORATE. Sadly, I recently heard that they've decided to end the show after its third season, effectively making my spec worthless. (But let's be honest, what has worth now-a-days).

So I said "Hell! I'm a smart guy! I'll just send this thing to my friends in the BIZ!"

"Not so fast!" Said my wizend friend. "Your friends in the BIZ can't read your spec for fear of being sued by you!"

So I figured that If I published alongside the script a permissive [Creative Commons License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/cc-by-sa-4.0/#) that would apply to my work, We'd all be covered. I'd get the joy of maybe having some people I respect to read my work, and you'd not have to worry about it.

[So here's my work. Check it out.](https://github.com/ultamatt/corporate_spec/blob/master/Entrepreneurship.pdf)
